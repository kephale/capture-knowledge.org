A solution that evaluates picks from a Copick project against a multilabel segmentation and computes metrics for each (user_id, session_id, object_name) pair for each run and across all runs.

## Arguments

- **copick_config_path** (string): Path to the Copick configuration JSON file.
- **painting_segmentation_name** (string): Name of the painting segmentation.
- **voxel_spacing** (integer): Voxel spacing used to scale pick locations.
- **segmentation_idx_offset** (integer): Offset for segmentation indices (default 0).
- **output_stats_dir** (string): Directory to save output statistics.
