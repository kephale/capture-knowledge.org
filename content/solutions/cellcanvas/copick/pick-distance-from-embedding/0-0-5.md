Creates a new set of picks for a new session ID, containing the same locations but including the distance to the median embedding in the 'score' attribute.

## Arguments

- **copick_config_path** (string): Path to the Copick configuration JSON file.
- **run_name** (string): Name of the Copick run to process.
- **session_id** (string): Session ID to filter picks.
- **new_session_id** (string): New session ID for the newly created picks.
- **feature_types** (string): Comma-separated list of feature types to extract embeddings for.
- **radius** (integer): Radius for calculating median embeddings.
- **tomo_type** (string): Tomogram type to use for each tomogram, e.g. denoised.
