A solution that compares the picks from a reference user and session to a candidate user and session for all particle types, providing metrics like average distance, precision, recall, and F-beta score. Computes micro-averaged F-beta score across all runs if run_name is not provided.

## Arguments

- **copick_config_path** (string): Path to the Copick configuration JSON file.
- **reference_user_id** (string): User ID for the reference picks.
- **reference_session_id** (string): Session ID for the reference picks.
- **candidate_user_id** (string): User ID for the candidate picks.
- **candidate_session_id** (string): Session ID for the candidate picks.
- **distance_threshold** (float): Distance threshold multiplier for matching points (e.g., 1.5x the radius as default).
- **beta** (float): Beta value for the F-beta score.
- **run_name** (string): Name of the Copick run to process. If not specified all runs will be processed.
- **output_json** (string): Path to save the output JSON file with the results.
- **weights** (string): Comma-separated list of weights for each particle type (e.g., particle1=1,particle2=2).
