Generates a file containing the median embeddings for each object type based on the picks in multiple runs, filtered by user IDs if provided.

## Arguments

- **copick_config_path** (string): Path to the Copick configuration JSON file.
- **run_names** (string): Comma-separated list of run names to process.
- **feature_types** (string): Comma-separated list of feature types to extract embeddings for.
- **voxel_spacing** (integer): Voxel spacing used to scale pick locations.
- **tomo_type** (string): Tomogram type to use for each tomogram, e.g. denoised.
- **radius** (integer): Radius for calculating median embeddings.
- **user_ids** (string): Comma-separated list of user IDs to filter picks by. If not provided, all picks will be processed.
- **output_path** (string): Path for the output file.
