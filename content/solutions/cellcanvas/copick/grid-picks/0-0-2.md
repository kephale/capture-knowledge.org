A solution that places a grid of picks based on the radius of each pickable object, parameterized by a multiple of the particle radius, using tomogram shape.

## Arguments

- **copick_config_path** (string): Path to the Copick configuration JSON file.
- **grid_spacing_factor** (float): Factor to multiply the particle radius by to determine grid spacing.
- **run_name** (string): Name of the Copick run to process. If not specified, process all runs.
- **tomo_type** (string): Type of tomogram to process.
- **voxel_spacing** (float): Voxel spacing to be used.
- **session_id** (string): Session ID for the segmentation.
- **user_id** (string): User ID for segmentation creation.
