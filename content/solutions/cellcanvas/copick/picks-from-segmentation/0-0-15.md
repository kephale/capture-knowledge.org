A solution that extracts centroids from a multilabel segmentation using Copick and saves them as candidate picks.

## Arguments

- **copick_config_path** (string): Path to the Copick configuration JSON file.
- **painting_segmentation_name** (string): Name of the painting segmentation.
- **session_id** (string): Session ID for the segmentation.
- **user_id** (string): User ID for segmentation creation.
- **voxel_spacing** (integer): Voxel spacing used to scale pick locations.
- **run_name** (string): Name of the Copick run to process.
- **segmentation_dir** (string): Directory containing the multilabel segmentation.
- **min_particle_size** (integer): Minimum size threshold for particles.
- **max_particle_size** (integer): Maximum size threshold for particles.
- **maxima_filter_size** (integer): Size for the maximum detection filter (default 9).
- **segmentation_idx_offset** (integer): Offset for segmentation indices (default 0).
- **labels_to_process** (string): Comma-separated list of labels to process.
