Uses multithreading to compare median embeddings from multiple Zarr datasets to known class medians and identifies matches based on a configurable distance threshold.

## Arguments

- **embedding_directories** (string): Paths to the embedding Zarr directories separated by commas.
- **median_embeddings_path** (string): Path to the CSV file with median embeddings and distances.
- **matches_output_path** (string): Path for the output file containing matches.
- **distance_threshold** (float): Distance threshold factor to consider a match.
