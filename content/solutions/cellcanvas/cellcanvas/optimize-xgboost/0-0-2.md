A solution that optimizes an XGBoost model using Optuna, data from a Zarr zip store, and performs 10-fold cross-validation.

## Arguments

- **input_zarr_path** (string): Path to the input Zarr zip store containing the features and labels.
- **output_model_path** (string): Path for the output joblib file containing the trained XGBoost model.
- **best_params_path** (string): Path for the output file containing the best parameters from Optuna.
- **n_splits** (string): Number of splits for cross-validation.
- **subset_size** (string): Total number of points for balanced subset.
- **seed** (string): Random seed for reproducibility.
- **num_trials** (integer): Number of Optuna trials to run.
- **objective_function** (string): Objective function to optimize. Options are: accuracy, f1, precision, recall.
