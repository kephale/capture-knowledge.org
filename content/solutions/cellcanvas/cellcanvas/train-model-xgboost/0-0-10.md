A solution that trains an XGBoost model using data from a Zarr zip store, filters runs with only one label, and performs 10-fold cross-validation.

## Arguments

- **input_zarr_path** (string): Path to the input Zarr zip store containing the features and labels.
- **output_model_path** (string): Path for the output joblib file containing the trained XGBoost model.
- **eta** (float): Step size shrinkage used in update to prevents overfitting.
- **gamma** (float): Minimum loss reduction required to make a further partition on a leaf node of the tree.
- **max_depth** (integer): The maximum depth of the trees.
- **min_child_weight** (float): Minimum sum of instance weight needed in a child.
- **max_delta_step** (float): Maximum delta step we allow each leaf output to be.
- **subsample** (float): Subsample ratio of the training instances.
- **colsample_bytree** (float): Subsample ratio of columns when constructing each tree.
- **reg_lambda** (float): L2 regularization term on weights.
- **reg_alpha** (float): L1 regularization term on weights.
- **max_bin** (integer): Maximum number of discrete bins to bucket continuous features.
- **class_weights** (string): Class weights for the XGBoost model as a comma-separated list.
