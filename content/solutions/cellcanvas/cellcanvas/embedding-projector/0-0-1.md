Automatically generate Tensorboard event files and launch a visualizer for it. Currently suppot zarr and npy files.

## Arguments

- **channel_first** (boolean): Channel first for the embedding vectors. Default is True.
- **embeddings** (string): Path to the feature vector embeddings
- **labels** (string): Path to the labels correspond to the embeddings. Labels should be (N,) shape or a flattened array.
- **embed_zarr_key** (string): Key to get the embeding zarr file.
- **label_zarr_key** (string): Key to get the label zarr file.
- **label_img** (string): Path to the npy image files corresponds to the embeddings.
- **logdir** (string): Output directory name in the current working directory/runs. Default is runs/tensorboard
- **k** (float): Percentage of the features to visualize (<= 1000). Default is 0.01
- **port** (string): Port number to launch Tensorboard server. Default is 6006
