A solution that trains a LightGBM model using data from a Zarr zip store, filters runs with only one label, and performs 10-fold cross-validation.

## Arguments

- **input_zarr_path** (string): Path to the input Zarr zip store containing the features and labels.
- **output_model_path** (string): Path for the output joblib file containing the trained LightGBM model.
- **n_estimators** (integer): Number of trees in the LightGBM model.
- **max_depth** (integer): The maximum depth of the trees.
- **learning_rate** (float): The learning rate.
- **num_leaves** (integer): Maximum number of leaves.
- **class_weights** (string): Class weights for the LightGBM model as a comma-separated list.
