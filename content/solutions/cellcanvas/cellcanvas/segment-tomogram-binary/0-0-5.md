## Arguments

- **copick_config_path** (string): Path to the Copick configuration JSON file.
- **session_id** (string): Session ID for the segmentation.
- **user_id** (string): User ID for segmentation creation.
- **voxel_spacing** (integer): Voxel spacing used to scale pick locations.
- **run_name** (string): Name of the Copick run to process.
- **tomo_type** (string): Type of tomogram to use, e.g., denoised.
- **feature_names** (string): Comma-separated list of feature names to use, e.g., cellcanvas01,cellcanvas02.
- **model_dir** (string): Directory containing the trained models.
- **segmentation_name** (string): Name of the output segmentation.
