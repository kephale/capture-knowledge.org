A solution that trains a Random Forest model using data from a Zarr zip store, filters runs with only one label, and performs cross-validation.

## Arguments

- **input_zarr_path** (string): Path to the input Zarr zip store containing the features and labels.
- **output_model_path** (string): Path for the output joblib file containing the trained Random Forest model.
- **n_estimators** (integer): Number of trees in the Random Forest.
- **max_depth** (integer): The maximum depth of the trees.
- **max_samples** (float): The maximum number of samples to draw from X to train each base estimator.
- **min_samples_split** (integer): The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node.
- **min_samples_leaf** (integer): The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.
- **class_weights** (string): Class weights for the Random Forest model as a comma-separated list.
- **n_splits** (integer): Number of folds for cross-validation.
