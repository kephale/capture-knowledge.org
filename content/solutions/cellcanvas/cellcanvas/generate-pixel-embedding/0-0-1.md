Apply a SwinUNETR model to a tomogram fetched using the Copick API to produce embeddings, and save them in a Zarr.

## Arguments

- **copick_config_path** (string): Path to the Copick configuration JSON file.
- **run_name** (string): Name of the Copick run to process.
- **voxel_spacing** (float): Voxel spacing to be used.
- **tomo_type** (string): Type of tomogram to process.
- **checkpointpath** (string): Path to the checkpoint file of the trained SwinUNETR model
- **embedding_name** (string): Name of the embedding to use as the feature name in Copick
