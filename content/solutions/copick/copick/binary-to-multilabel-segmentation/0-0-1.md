Creates a multilabel segmentation by combining individual segmentations for all pickable objects, including particles, in a Copick project. Can process a single run or all runs in the project.

## Arguments

- **copick_config_path** (string): Path to the Copick configuration file.
- **voxel_spacing** (float): Voxel spacing to use for the segmentation.
- **input_user_id** (string): User ID for input segmentations.
- **input_session_id** (string): Session ID for input segmentations.
- **run_name** (string): Name of the run to process. If not provided, all runs will be processed.
- **output_user_id** (string): User ID for the output multilabel segmentation.
- **multilabel_name** (string): Name for the new multilabel segmentation.
