An album solution to run a virtual creatures simulation using pygfx and NumPy with Hooke-style springs, sinusoidal joint rotations, gravity, and floor interactions. The agents are randomly connected.

## Arguments

- **num_agents** (integer): Number of agents in the simulation
- **max_speed** (float): Maximum speed of agents
- **spring_constant** (float): Spring constant for Hookes Law
- **damping** (float): Damping factor for the springs
- **boundary_size** (float): Size of the boundary for the simulation
- **gravity** (float): Gravitational force applied to the agents
- **floor_elasticity** (float): Elasticity of the floor when agents collide with it
